    "# Multi Task Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically care about optimising for a single, particular metric, for which we generally train a single model or an ensemble of models to perform our desired task. We have seem how we might fine-tune these models in the training process until their performance no longer increases in-sample. While we can generally achieve acceptable performance this way, by being overly focused on our single task, we might not see information that might help us do even better. Specifically, this information comes from the training signals of related tasks. By sharing representations between related tasks, we can enable our model to generalize better on our original task. This approach is called Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and will be the topic of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-task learning is a cutting edge area of ML and has been used successfully across all applications of machine learning, from natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, and drug discovery. MTL comes in many guises: joint learning, learning to learn, and learning with auxiliary tasks are only some names that have been used to refer to it. As soon as you find yourself optimizing more than one loss function while \"parameter sharing\", you are effectively doing multi-task learning (in contrast to single-task learning). In those scenarios, it helps to think about what you are trying to do explicitly in terms of MTL and to draw insights from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a finance context, returns are the result we want but they are very noisy with respect to signals from our dataset.\n",
    "It makes intuitive sense to forecast a proxy variable, even if your forecasting error is lower. It may make even more sense to forecast many proxies as well as the lal important return. This is what we will do in a simple way in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than forcast the singular outcome of return, we are going to forecast ROE, separately forecast returns and combine the outcomes of the two learners using a simple trick which implicitly results in parameter sharing..."

    "At the moment we have only been using our models to predict the average return of a company. This means that if we were to use our models to select stocks then we would only be selecting stocks that were predicted to have a good average return. In this section, we will look at creating a multi-objective-learner, and a simple way of achieving parameter sharing for multi-task-learning. \n",
