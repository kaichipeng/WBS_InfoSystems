Welcome to the Warwick Bussiness School Financial Technology - Machine Learning Driven Quantitative Investment Github repository. This repository is unique in that it contains machine learning techniques, models and advanced approaches that are directly applied to a investing in a broad universe of global equities. We uses the strongest Python libraries to drive machine learning approaches for equities selection and investment. Casuality is our bottom-line, and we take you on a journey from Granger causality, through to employing a ML toolkit cultminating in cutting edge XAI and mutli-task-machine-learning to get us to powerfuly, causal, explainable machine learning investment systems. (The authors do this stuff for real btw). 

We start our journey by loading our extensive dataset of several thousand global stocks across emerging and developed markets. We learn how to preprocess the data, impute, normalise and stack the information, ready for our learners. We touch on dimensionality reduction using powerful neural, autoencoders. We take a short digression into Granger Causality as a foundation for the causality we want from our ML. Our learners start with OLS, ElasticNets, Random Forests, Artificial Neural Nets, before we get deep into cutting edge explainable AI (XAI). 

Explainability is crucial in finance and other domains where we are making critical decisions and those decisions may need to be scrutinised by clients, regulators, whoever. We look at LIME and SHAP as XAI approaches to explain the working of black box learners. Finally we end on the advanced topic of mutli-task learning, one of the most powerful ways of achieving causal driven learning. 

This site contains the Python code for our module. The notebooks are designed to be self standing and can be worked through in your own time. The raw data that we will be using can be found in the [`Data`](Data) folder. 

## Contents 
  1. [loading_data.ipynb](https://github.com/danphilps/WBS_InfoSystems/blob/main/loading_data.ipynb) - For those of you that have downloaded the data in the data in the XLSX format, this notebook shows you how we can use Python to automatically convert the worksheets in the XLSX into seperate CSV which are much faster to work with in Python.
  2. [preprocessing_pt1.ipynb](preprocessing_pt1.ipynb) - We formulate our problem... machine elarning driven quanitative investing, extract the data, stack it, preprocess it and learn how to impute missing values.
  3. [preprocessing_pt2.ipynb](preprocessing_pt2.ipynb) - We learn how to deal with categorical data such as country, sector static info for our stocks, we touch on PCA to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset (thus making it much easier to pass into many learners) and finish by looking at non-linear dimensionslity reduction by super powerful neural based auto-encoders.
  4. [time_series_forecasting_causality.ipynb](learners.ipynb) - We pause to look at simple techniques ot view our dataset and construct simple Econometric style time-series learners, concluding this notebook with Granger-causality. 
  5. [learners.ipynb](learners.ipynb) - Now the nitty gritty. Machine learning (ML) learners applied to our prepped dataset. We start with simple ordinary least squares regression (OLS) used to illustrate learner basics and to look at the weaknesses of OLS. The lesson is don't forget Econometrics, it will help in our machine learning. We progress to Regularisation, ElasticNets regresison, RandomForest, Neural nets. We then use XAI, explainable AI, using cutting edge tools to show how the outputs and dynamics of black box learners can be explained. LIME, SHAP are examined.   
  6. [MLT.ipynb](MLT.ipynb) - Finally we touch upon another cutting edge topic, multi-task-learning, where by learning multiple outcomes we can strengthen the results of out learner. We introduce a simple and cheap approach to MTL specific to finance that we have developed. 

We hope you enjoy our course and get loads out of it. 

## Downloading and running the code

The first step is to download the repository onto your computer. To do this click the green code button in top right of this page and click download as zip.

Once you have downloaded the zip folder put it into an appropriate place, right click the zip folder and click extract all. 

<img src="Images/extract_all.png" width=400px >

You should now have a folder called `WBS_InfoSystems-main` that contains all of the files and folders that you see in this repository. As mentioned before there are quite a lot of packages that have been used in this repository. To avoid any potential conflicts between packages you may have already installed we will install the packages needed for this repository in a new conda environment. Start by opening the anaconda command prompt. You should see a window similar to the one shown below.

<img src="Images/command_prompt.png" width=400px >

Now navigate to the `WBS_InfoSystems-main` folder using the `cd` command.

Inside the `WBS_InfoSystems-main` folder, there is a file called `environment.yml` which contains the information needed to configure the conda environment. We can create a new environment based on `environment.yml` using the command `conda env create --name fintech --file=environment.yml` which creates an environment called fintech. Just a warning, installing all can take a while.

After we have create the fintech environment, we can activate it using `conda activate fintech` and open jupyter notebook by simply typing `jupyter notebook`.

Opening jupyter notebook from within the conda environment ensures that jupyter notebook is opened using the fintech environment.
